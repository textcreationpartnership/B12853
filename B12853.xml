         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to that purpoſe ſithence, hath publiſhed diuers Proclamations, and granted diuers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to ſome of the Lords of His Priuie Counſell and others (by time and experience found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) for the better ordering and effecting that ſo worthy a worke; whoſe care and endeuour in the execution of thoſe Proclamations and Commiſſions, His Maieſtie doth graciouſly accept, and highly commend. And whereas His Maieſtie, from time to time remayning conſtant to his former reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath now found apparant and manifeſt, what himſelfe preiudged, that the materials of Bricke are of farre better vſe then thoſe of Timber, for ſuch of His Subiects as haue occaſion to build, in, or neere the ſayd City of <hi>London,</hi> and tendeth not onely to the preſeruation of the ſayd City, and places adioyning, from diuers inconueniences and miſchiefes, which might happen by reaſon of building the walles and forefronts of houſes there with Timber, but alſo to the beautifying and adorning the ſame City and places adiacent, to the honour, beauty, and luſtre thereof, which for this ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:185830:2"/>time of proceeding with Bricke, is greatly applauded and approoued, aſwell by Ambaſſadours of forren Nations, as others: His Maieſtie doth therefore heereby encourage his ſayd Commiſſioners, and require them, as they haue begun with care and endeuour, ſo to continue their vigilancy ouer this ſo good a worke, and from time to time, to put in execution His Maieſties gracious and Princely commandements therein, and to chaſtiſe and reforme all thoſe that are, or ſhall be contemptuous or diſobedient to the ſame.</p>

For preuention whereof His Maieſtie, hauing (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deliberate conſideration and aduice, of men of iudgement, experience, and worth, for the generall good of His Subiects that ſhall be occaſioned to build with Bricke) cauſed theſe enſuing Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Directions to be deuiſed, as rules to be obſerued, in the true making and ſale of Brickes, Hath thought it neceſſary to publiſh the ſame to His louing Subiects, and doth heereby ſtraitly charge and command, that no perſon or perſons after the laſt day of this preſent moneth of <hi>Nouember,</hi> doe make or cauſe to be made within fiue miles of any the gates of the ſayd City of <hi>London,</hi> or bring or conuey, or cauſe to be brought or conueyed, either by water or by land, vnto the ſayd City of <hi>London,</hi> or any place or places within fiue miles of the gates of the ſame City, or vtter, ſell, or put to ſale, within the ſayd City, or in any place or places within fiue miles thereof, as aforeſayd, to any perſon or perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, at any time or times heereafter, any Brickes, made contrary to the true meaning of theſe His Maieſties Directions, or at any higher price or rate then is heerin after mentioned, vpon paine of His Maieſties indignation, and diſpleaſure, and the ſeuereſt cenſure of his Court of Starre chamber, and ſuch further paines and puniſhments, as by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, may bee inflicted vpon them for their offences and contempt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the earth whereof the Brickes ſhall bee made, bee good and fit for that purpoſe; The firſt digging thereof to be betweene the feaſts of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angell, and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; And the ſecond digging, turning, or caſting vp of the ſayd earth to be, at, or before the laſt day of <hi>February</hi> enſuing; And that no perſon whatſoeuer doe preſume to digge, or make any Bricke in any place within one mile of the Gates of the ſayd City of <hi>London,</hi> from and after the laſt day of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moneth of <hi>Nouember.</hi>

               <hi>Item,</hi> that in the moulding of the ſayd Brickes, the mouldes bee throughly and well filled, and not ſet in the moulds, in the laying downe, and that they bee ſufficiently and well dried before they bee burned, and then carefully and throughly burned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> that for the Aſſize, euery Bricke being burned conteine in length, nine inches, in breadth, fowre inches one quarter and halfe a quarter of an inch, and in thickneſſe, two inches and one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an inch.</p>
